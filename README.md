# Stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

**A little about me:**

* I am undertaking a degree in *statistics* and psychology
* I am taking *STATS 220* because I need the credits!
* I am interested in learning about programming languauges and using github

**Some of the statistics papers I've already taken**

1. *Stats 240*
2. *Stats 330*
3. *Stats 380*

One part of the statistics programme in UOA that I find particularly interesting are the [Ihaka lectures!](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/department-of-statistics/ihaka-lecture-series.html)
